Wordpress Flickr Manager
===

My fork of Trent Gardner's great Wordpress plugin, [Wordpress Flickr Manager](http://trentgardner.net/wordpress-flickr-manager/).

A few minor tweaks to ease Flickr based posts:

- Flickr photos are automatically placed in the same group when the window opens.  This allows each post to be one set of photos as the user scrolls through.
- Picture sub menu closes as soon as you insert a Flickr photo, so you don't have to manually close it each time.
- Plugin now automatically tries to set lightbox size for you, so you dont' have to manually select a size for each photo.
